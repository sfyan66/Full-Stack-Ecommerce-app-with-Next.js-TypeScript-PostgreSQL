InformationTechnologyIT = `is the application of computers and telecommunications
  equipment to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data. More formally`;

Definition = `(IT) encompasses the 
  entire spectrum of tools, methods, and resources used to create, process,  store,  
  secure,  retrieve,  and exchange electronic data. It is a broad field that spans 
  various technical disciplines and plays a critical role in modern society.`;

Trend 1: The AI Revolution and Data Team Formation
  The ultimate goal of AI is to enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

Trend 2: Cloud Computing and Serverless Architecture
  Cloud Computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, and software—over the Internet ("the cloud").
    -Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
    -Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    -Software as a Service (SaaS)

Trend 3: Cybersecurity and the Zero Trust Model
    -Identity-First Security
    -AI-Driven Attacks
    -Supply Chain Risk
  Zero Trust: operating on the principle of"never trust, always verify."

Trend 4: The Internet of Things (IoT)
  the vast network of physical objects ("things") embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.
    -devices/sensors themselves
    -connectivity (like Wi-Fi or 5G) 
    -data processing
    -user interfac

AIoT (Artiﬁcial Intelligence of Things)
  enabling connected "things" (sensors, appliances) to learn, predict, and act autonomously without constant human/cloud input.
    -fasterdecision-making 
    -reduces internet bandwidth usage 
    -and improves privacy =>  byprocessing data locally before sending it to the cloud.

Edge Computing 
  Distributed computing paradigm where data processing occurs near the source (e.g., on-device, gateways, or local servers) rather than centralized clouds, minimizing latency and bandwidth use for time-sensitive apps.

Intellectual property (IP)
  is used to describe works of the mind—such as art, books, films, formulas, inventions, music, and software that are owned or created by a single person or group.
    -IP is a creation of the mind that has commercial value.

Plagiarism
  copying text or ideas from someone else and claiming them as your own
    
Hoaxes
  anything designed to deceive another person

Online Reputation
  It is the perception that people form about you based on all the information about you that exists online.

The Hacker's Toolkit
  Port Scanners
    Tools like Nmap are used to scan a target network to see which ports are open. An open port can indicate a running service (like a web server or database) that might be vulnerable.
  Vulnerability Scanners
    Software like Nessus or OpenVAS automatically scans systems for known vulnerabilities, such as unpatched software or misconfigurations.
  Password Crackers
    Programs like John the Ripper or Hashcat are used to guess or "crack" user passwords, often by trying millions of combinations (a brute-force attack) or using lists of common passwords (a dictionary attack).
  Network Analyzers (Sniffers)
    Tools like Wireshark capture and inspect data packets traveling over a network. If the traffic is unencrypted, an attacker can read sensitive information like usernames and passwords.
  Exploitation Frameworks
    Platforms like Metasploit bundle together a vast collection of known exploits, allowing an attacker to easily launch attacks against vulnerable systems once a weakness is identified.

Malware
  Malicious software designed to harm devices, steal information, or perform unauthorized actions.

Phishing Attacks
  Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by impersonating a trustworthy entity.

SIM Swapping
  A technique where attackers convince a mobile carrier to transfer a victim's phone number to a new SIM card controlled by the attacker.

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
  An attack where the attacker intercepts communication between two parties without their knowledge.

Ransomware
  Malicious software that encrypts a victim's data, demanding a ransom for decryption.

Spyware
  Software that secretly monitors user activity and collects personal information without consent.

mobile phone attacks
  1. User Behavior
  2. Social Engineering
  3. Vulnerabilities in Operating Systems
  4. Public Wi-Fi Risks
  5. Availability of Tools
  6. Device Proliferation
  7. Lack of Security Measures

Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  The first line of defense is proving that you are who you say you are. This is the core of Identity and Access Management (IAM).
